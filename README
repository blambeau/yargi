= Yargi

Yargi aims at providing a powerful mutable digraph implementation. As reflected by its name,
Yargi as Yet Another (Ruby) Graph Implementation: we all have implemented a graph data structure
in almost every language that we use, probably many times. The reason is probably that each 
implementation has its own design decisions that makes the data-structure well-designed for
the task at hand, or not. Below are the main design decisions made by Yargi.

[Digraph, Vertex and Edge] Unlike {RGL}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rgl/], Yargi implements
                           graph components through concrete classes, not modules (that is, in 
                           a standard-but-closed way).
[Markable pattern] Graphs, vertices and edges are markable through a Hash-like API: users can
                   install their own key/value pairs on each graph element. When keys are Symbol
                   objects, accessors are automatically generated to provide a friendly object-oriented
                   API (this feature must be used with care, for obvious reasons).
[Typed elements] Graph elements (vertices and edges) can be tagged with your own modules (at creation,
                 or later). This is the standard Yarvi way to apply a 'select-and-do' feature: connect
                 all these vertices to these ones, for example.
[Mutable graphs] Graphs here are mutable, mutable and mutable and this is the reason why Yargi
                 exists. It comes from a project where manipulating graphs by reconnecting edges,
                 removing vertices is the norm, not the exception.
[Complexity don't care] The digraph implementation uses an incident list data structure. This graph
                        library has not been designed with efficiency in mind so that complexities 
                        are not documented nor guaranteed. That is not to say that improvements are
                        not welcome, of course.
[Ruby minded] Because we love that language!
                        
== Example

  # create a directed graph
  digraph = Yargi::Digraph.new

  # create 5 sources
  sources = digraph.add_n_vertices(5)

  # connect all
  edges = digraph.connect(sources, sources)

  # put some dot attributes
  sources.add_marks(:shape => 'circle', :label => '')
  edges.add_marks do |e|
    {:label => "From #{e.source.index} to #{e.target.index}"}
  end
  
  # and print it
  digraph.to_dot(STDOUT)
